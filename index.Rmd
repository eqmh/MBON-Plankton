<h4>

Much life in the sea depends on plankton diversity and production. As
the ocean changes, the many ecosystem functions of plankton - their
biodiversity, distribution, nutrient and carbon flows, timing of life
stages and blooms - change in ways that also alter ecosystem services
that other organisms, including humans, depend on. There is a need to
better understand and predict how these ecosystem functions of the
plankton community change on different time scales. Justifying
comprehensive regional and global studies of the role of plankton
biodiversity and ecosystem function will require understanding the
importance of plankton in an ecosystem services framework. This series
of virtual workshops brings scientists together to provide an overview
on the state-of-the-art of field, lab and modelling approaches used to
study plankton biodiversity and discuss data needs for improving our
understanding on the value of plankton, its functions and ecosystem
services. A goal is to align multiple research tools and approaches,
data, methods, protocols and knowledge to improve ecological
forecasting. This alignment is important to meet the goals of the UN
Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (the Ocean Decade)
through programs like Marine Life 2030, Digital Twins of the Ocean -
DITTO, and Ocean Practices for the Decade.

## Expected outcomes

<body>

<h4>

The goal of the workshops is to develop two international working groups
to:

1.  Develop community-agreed unit conversion tables (e.g., abundance to
    carbon) published as best practices documents and/or available as
    online tools, important for forecasting and global data
    metaanalysis.

2.  Write a synthesis paper on the ecological, biogeochemical, economic
    and recreational value of plankton with colleagues from different
    fields and regions for a global perspective.

<br>

Participants will propose research actions, each linked to specific
efforts for a multidisciplinary approach to the proposed topics (e.g.,
biological oceanography, data science, education, citizen science,
policy, socioeconomics, arts).
