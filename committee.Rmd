## Workshop Participants:

<h4>

The first workshop, supported by MBON, MODIV and OO RCN took place on
November 9-10, 2020, with participants from Europe and the USA. The
upcoming workshops in October 2021 seek to expand the geographic
representation of participants and we are thus encouraging researchers
from Africa, Asia, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, India and
Oceania to join us in this collective effort.
